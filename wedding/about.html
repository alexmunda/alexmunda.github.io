              <p>
                Thinking back about how I met Molly, I am truly amazed at how we got to where we are today. Who knew that two high school
                kids that couldn’t even drive yet would end up getting married 10 years later. A lot has changed over the 10 years since
                I met Molly: we broke up after I graduated high school so I could be a ‘cool college kid’ (turns out that was a terrible
                idea), we started talking again because of a misunderstanding by one of her friends 3 years later (thank you whoever you
                are), we somehow managed to survive a long distance relationship for 2 years (never again), and we bought a dog (love you
                Moose). I can tell you one thing though, I would not be the person I am today if I did not have her in my life.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-us-text">
              <p>
                When she’s not kicking butt in nursing school or saving lives as a nurse intern, Molly spends her time being an all around
                amazing woman. She’s a fantastic chef and her baking is incredible. I couldn’t ask for a better Euchre partner though I’m
                surprised she's kept me around this long after the number of times I’ve trumped her ace. She told me that we needed a dog
                and I thought she was crazy, that turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made (second to asking Molly to marry
                me of course). She’s also the most thoughtful and caring person I know, one time she surprised me with coffee and beer just
                because I did well in a job interview. You can’t not marry someone after they surprise you with two of the best things on
                the planet.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-us-text">
              <p>
                Did I mention that Molly makes me a better person? Who knows where I would be today had we not gone on our second first
                date. Oh yeah, I know, I wouldn’t be madly in love with the woman of my dreams that I cannot wait to spend the rest of my
                life with. I also wouldn’t know that apples, cinnamon, and applesauce are three of the best things you can combine in your
                morning oatmeal. Oatmeal I could probably live without, Molly I could not. I love her more than I can express in words, and
                I always will.

              <h4>Alex</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="about-us-text">
              <p>
                I have to be honest when putting this website together I saved this section for last because I wasn’t quite sure on how to
                give Alex justice. I could provide a laundry list of attributes to describe him but the list might be endless. I would say
                there a few things that stick out to me on why I love Alex so much. First, he is a huge family man. Doesn’t matter if it
                is my family or his he loves to spend time with them. He is often the one asking if we are having family dinner on Sunday
                and what to bring. I love that Alex is so connected with both of our families and willing to stop what he is doing to help
                any of us out.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-us-text">
              <p>
                Secondly, Alex might be the most selfless person I know. I do not think in the ten years I have known him he has made a
                decision solely based on his wants. He is constantly checking in and seeing how he can help take a burden off of me. He gets
                up early each morning to take care of Moose and is always willing to help clean or cook. His actions help teach me each day
                to be a little less selfish. Alex has provided me with countless amounts of laughter and great memories. I do not know anyone
                with a better sense of humor or willingness to laugh at himself. Without Alex I would not have nearly as much joy and humor
                in my life. He has taught me not take the world so seriously.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-us-text">
              <p>
                Without Alex, I would be lost on how to make the perfect cup of coffee nor be the person I am today. My favorite characteristic
                about Alex is his ability to make me a better person. He is constantly pushing me to achieve greatness or do the best I can.
                He is patient and kind but not afraid to encourage me to be or to do better. He is an amazing partner that can often finish
                my sentences and says exactly what I am thinking. He has an incredible work ethic that is apparent in all that he does.

                Mary Catherine or MC as she is lovingly nicknamed in our home is my younger sister but I look up to her for so many reasons;
                she is honest, intelligent, and hilarious. Truthfully, I don’t have many memories in my life without her. One of my earliest
                childhood memories is taking her home from the hospital on a hot August day. My dad took my brothers to go get the car and
                I was instructed to wait patiently with my mom for them to come pick us up. Instead of waiting patiently I ran around the
                waiting area singing I am a big sister on repeat. As you can imagine my mom was livid with me. MC and I became fast friends
                and did just about everything together.

              <p>
                Josh is Alex's younger brother. They almost shared a birthday, but 8 year old Alex told his mom that he didn't want to share
                a birthday, so she waited until the next day to have Josh. Josh doesn't say much, but when he does, it's comedic gold. Josh
                likes video games as much as every other teenage boy does, and he's reached the point where he beats Alex in every game they
                play together (except Super Smash Bros). We are all looking forward to Josh's best man speech, but I don't think he is. From
                helping Alex move into his apartment, to watching the Moose when Alex and Molly cannot, Josh is an all around great guy and
                a fantastic brother.

                Kalan and I met while we were studying at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln. She is one of the most compassionate and
                loving people I know. She is widely creative and decorated our house on Surfside perfectly. Kalan and I spent way too much
                time and money exploring local coffee shops and listening to John Mayer while in Lincoln. Kalan, I could not think of a better
                friend to support Al Pal and I on such a special day, your joy for life is contagious and I think everyone in the world would
                be better off if they had a Kalan by their side. Thanks for your continued friendship and moving to KC (wishful thinking?).

                whiskey and holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Jake is also getting married this year and unfortunately the proposal
                for a joint wedding didn't go over well with the fiances. Jake and Alex have recently picked up a habit of intentionally
                sabotaging Molly and Gina when playing board games. The girls don't like it, but Jake and Alex do it anyways. Jake is a great
                guy and I am excited for him to be a part of our wedding.

                Henry is Molly’s favorite nephew and they both share a love of dogs. When Henry is not busy making friends with everyone
                he meets, you might find him enjoying books, eating just about anything, or chasing after his dog Cooper. Henry has been
                such a sweet addition to our family and we love watching him grow. Henry we are so thankful that you agreed to be part of
                our wedding (maybe your mom said yes for you) and love you very much.
